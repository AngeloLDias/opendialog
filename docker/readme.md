## Docker Tools

This directory contains docker configurations that we frequently make use of. 

- `dgraph`  - used by our CI/CD tool to fire up a Dgraph instance so that we can test use of the graph db.
- `od-demo` - docker-compose cong that uses the latest OpenDialog image to setup a quick demo of OD.
